# Fortune Cookie Generator

This program takes a list of fortune cookie messages that i found and converts them to an array.

This program then generates a random set of Lucky Numbers

the program then calls a function that displays a random message from the list and adds the lucky numbers.


I struggled a lot with reading the .txt file and converting it to an array I finally found a solution that works maybe there's an easier solution. I didnt want to take the easy road and copy all the messages directly into the code.
